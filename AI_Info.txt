Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines which helps in allowing them to think and act like humans. 
It involves creating algorithms and systems that can perform tasks which requiring human abilities such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making and language translation.

*** Types of Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed industries, leading to significant advancements in technology, science, and everyday life. To understand AI better, we must first recognize that AI can be categorized into different types based on capabilities and functionalities.

Type 1: Based on Capabilities of AI

Narrow AI
General AI
Super AI

Type 2: Based on the Functionality of AI

Reactive Machines
Limited Memory AI
Theory of Mind
Self-Aware AI

*** Types of AI Based on Capabilities

1. Narrow AI (Weak AI)
Narrow AI is designed and trained on a specific task or a narrow range tasks. These Narrow AI systems are designed and trained for a purpose. These Narrow systems performs their designated tasks but mainly lack in the ability to generalize tasks.

Examples:

Voice assistants like Siri or Alexa that understand specific commands.
Facial recognition software used in security systems.
Recommendation engines used by platforms like Netflix or Amazon.
Despite being highly efficient at specific tasks, Narrow AI lacks the ability to function beyond its predefined scope. These systems do not possess understanding or awareness.

2. General AI (Strong AI)

General AI refers to AI systems that have human intelligence and abilities to perform various tasks. Systems have capability to understand, learn and apply across a wide range of tasks that are similar to how a human can adapt to various tasks.

While General AI remains a theoretical concept, researchers aim to develop AI systems that can perform any intellectual task a human can. It requires the machine to have consciousness, self-awareness, and the ability to make independent decisions, which is not yet achievable.

Potential Applications:
Robots that can learn new skills and adapt to unforeseen challenges in real-time.
AI systems that could autonomously diagnose and solve complex medical issues across various specializations.

3. Superintelligence (Super AI)
Super AI surpasses intelligence of human in solving-problem, creativity, and overall abilities. Super AI develops emotions, desires, need and beliefs of their own. They are able to make decisions of their own and solve problem of its own. Such AI would not only be able to complete tasks better than humans but also understand and interpret emotions and respond in a human-like manner.

While Super AI remains speculative, it could revolutionize industries, scientific research, and problem-solving, possibly leading to unprecedented advancements. However, it also raises ethical concerns regarding control and regulation.


***Types of AI Based on Functionalities

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become central to applications in healthcare, finance, education and many more. However, AI operates differently at various levels based on how it processes data, learns and responds. Classifying AI by its functionalities helps us better understand its current capabilities and its potential evolution.

This article explores the four main types of AI based on functionalities.

1. Reactive AI
Reactive AI is the simplest form of artificial intelligence. These systems are designed to respond to specific inputs with pre-programmed rules. Despite their simplicity, reactive systems can perform complex tasks efficiently when the environment is predictable.

Key Characteristics:

No Memory or Learning: Every decision is based on current input i.e no history is stored or used.
Predefined Responses: Actions are rule-based or driven by fixed algorithms.
Task-Specific Functionality: Designed for repetitive tasks with clear rules.
No Adaptability: Cannot modify behaviour based on outcomes or feedback.

Examples:
IBM Deep Blue: The chess-playing system that defeated Garry Kasparov in 1997 could calculate possible moves and counters but lacked learning ability.
Google AlphaGo: Known for defeating top Go players, it calculates optimal moves in real time without learning across games. It remains reactive during each match.
Simple Chatbots: Some early customer service bots that respond to predefined inputs with scripted answers.
2. Limited Memory AI
Limited Memory AI builds upon reactive systems by using the ability to learn from historical data. It can use past observations to make more informed decisions, making them suitable for environments where conditions change over time.

Key Characteristics:

Data-Driven Decisions: Uses stored data from previous interactions to improve accuracy.
Model Training: Relies on large volumes of data for supervised or unsupervised learning.
Short-Term Memory: Retains recent data for a limited duration, does not have a persistent sense of learning like humans.
Improved Adaptability: Performs better in real-world tasks such as driving, speech recognition or fraud detection.

Examples:
Self-Driving Cars: Vehicles use past sensor data and historical driving patterns to make real-time decisions.
Image Recognition Systems: Trained on large datasets to classify objects more accurately based on previous learning.
Large Language Models: Can recall recent prompts during a conversation and use past dialogue to generate responses. They don’t retain memory across sessions unless explicitly designed with long-term memory modules.
3. Theory of Mind AI
Theory of Mind AI represents a more advanced class of AI that is still under research. It aims to simulate human-like understanding of emotions and intentions. Such systems would be able to engage more naturally with humans by recognizing mental states and social contexts.

Key Characteristics:

Emotional Intelligence: Designed to interpret emotional cues such as tone, expressions and gestures.
Cognitive Modeling: Capable of human reasoning or predicting how others might think or feel.
Interactive Reasoning: Engages in more dynamic decision-making by factoring in beliefs, goals and intentions of others.
Examples:

Sophia the Robot (Hanson Robotics): Although mostly scripted, Sophia demonstrates simulated emotional expressions and responses in conversations, replicating human interaction.
MIT’s Kismet: One of the early experiments in social robotics that responded to human voice tones and facial expressions with corresponding emotional displays.
4. Self-Aware AI: Theoretical Consciousness
Self-Aware AI is the most advanced and hypothetical form of artificial intelligence. These systems have consciousness and the ability to reflect on their own mental states. They could make autonomous decisions based on internal motivations or beliefs and would be a fundamental leap in machine intelligence.

Key Characteristics:

Conscious Awareness: Understands its own existence, internal state and possibly the emotional impact of its actions.
Independent Learning: Learns not just from data but also from self-reflection or goal setting.
Ethical and Existential Challenges: Raises questions about rights, autonomy and potential risks if systems exceed human control.

Examples:
Science Fiction AI: HAL 9000 (2001: A Space Odyssey), Ava (Ex Machina) depict machines that are fully self-aware, capable of making independent decisions based on their perceived identity and purpose.
Theoretical AI Models: Currently explored only in philosophy and advanced ethics research, no existing AI systems possess genuine self-awareness or consciousness.
